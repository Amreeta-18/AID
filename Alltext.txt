the doc

is very stale and lots of portions need a re-write.

 mark the issue as fresh with /remove-lifecycle stale.
 stale issues rot after an additional 30d of inactivity and eventually
 close.

 if this issue is safe to close now please do so with /close.

it looks like there are broken dependencies:
$ go get -u k8s.io/test-infra/kubetest
taking a look at the aws-k8s-tester repo,there is no file or directory called ekstester
any advice?
go: extracting github.com/mattn/go-ieproxy v0.0.0-20200121124216-6d733ce01d10

they are not up to date enough imo,i would happily review any changes to them.  my bandwidth for updating them myself is low
spiffxp
oct 13,2020
at a glance,a few things i would recommend:
drop references to ci-test.k8s.io and pr-test.k8s.io,instead refer to:
prow.k8s.io
testgrid.k8s.io
prow.k8s.io/an/example/spyglass/path/for/a/specific/ci-job
prow.k8s.io/an/example/spyglass/path/for/a/specific/pr-job
instructions on how to get kubetest (iirc it can't be installed via go get)
rewrite kinds of tests to instead be test tags,include test tags that aren't yet documented ([disabledforlargeclusters] is one i'm aware of off the top of my head)
i might recommend using kind to run e2e tests (and examples to do so),that may already exist elsewhere
@bentheelder
?
the "performance evaluation" content may be stale,i feel like that should move to or reference scalability docs with a link
